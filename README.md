# Monorepo Skeleton

Monorepo
source: <https://itnext.io/guide-react-app-monorepo-with-lerna-d932afb2e875>

## Install

Use yarn only

- `yarn install` in root,
- `yarn install` for the CRA App inside packages too.

## Storybook

For component GUI
`yarn storybook`

## Structure

Inside `packages` folder has 2 repo.
one is button component repo (yes, this could be a general UI repo like ~violet~)
another one is sample CRA App, like any other webview project or static web page.

## Notes

I actually kinds for what else you need,
there was some lerna command in the progress but
please refer to the source above again, for understanding the concept too.
